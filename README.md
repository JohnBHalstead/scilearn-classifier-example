scilearn classification function approximation performance on scikit-learn's moon, circle, and linear data.

Modified from https://scikit-learn.org/ , Original authors: Gaël Varoquaux,Andreas Müller, and Jaques Grobler.

The code produces an ellegant graphic that illustrates scilearn's classification function accuracy on the three contained data sets (moon, circle, and linear). 

The graphic also bolsters Hastie, et al., "The Elements of Statistical Learning", page 313, Table 10.1, Some characteristics of different learning methods, along with John Elder's analysis of various function approximations on R data sets.
